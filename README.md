# histogram-equalization
Histogram equalization on an image  using OpenCV on google colab. Histogram equalization enhances the overall contrast and brightness of the image by redistributing pixel intensities.

Histogram Results:

Before equalization, the histogram of the original image might exhibit uneven peaks,
indicating an uneven distribution of pixel intensities.

After equalization, the histogram becomes more evenly distributed across the intensity
range, indicating improved contrast and brightness.
